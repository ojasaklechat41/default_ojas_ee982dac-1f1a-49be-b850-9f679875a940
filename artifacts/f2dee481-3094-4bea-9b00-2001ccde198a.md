# Technical Requirements Artifact

To develop a Proof of Concept (POC) for an e-commerce platform with the specified features, the following technical specifications, constraints, and system requirements are necessary:

### Technical Specifications

1. **Architecture:**
   - Microservices or Monolithic architecture (depending on scalability needs).
   - RESTful API design for interoperability.
   - MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern for organized codebase.

2. **Frontend:**
   - Framework: React.js, Vue.js, or Angular.
   - HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for basic web technologies.
   - Responsive design principles for mobile compatibility (Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS).

3. **Backend:**
   - Language: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), or Java (Spring Boot).
   - Database: 
     - Relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured product data.
     - NoSQL (MongoDB) for flexibility with unstructured data.
   - ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool (e.g., Sequelize, Hibernate).

4. **Authentication:**
   - User Authentication Method: JWT (JSON Web Token) or OAuth 2.0.
   - Password hashing: bcrypt or Argon2.

5. **Payment Integration:**
   - Payment Gateway: Stripe, PayPal, or Square (considering ease of integration).
   - Secure handling of payment methods (SSL/TLS for data encryption).

6. **Hosting and Deployment:**
   - Cloud service provider: AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
   - Containerization: Docker for environment consistency.
   - CI/CD setup for smooth deployment cycles.

7. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Application monitoring: NewRelic, Datadog, or similar.
   - Logging: Use frameworks like Winston (Node.js) or Log4j (Java).

8. **Version Control:**
   - Git for version control (repository management on GitHub or GitLab).

### System Requirements

1. **User Registration/Login:**
   - Email verification support.
   - Password recovery mechanism.

2. **Product Listing and Search:**
   - Pagination and filtering options for easy navigation.
   - Basic product attributes (name, description, price, images).

3. **Shopping Cart:**
   - Ability to add and remove items.
   - Persistent cart (session storage or cookie-based).

4. **Checkout Process:**
   - Form validation for billing/shipping details.
   - Order summary page.

5. **Payment Integration:**
   - Integration with at least one major payment gateway.
   - Support for major credit/debit cards and possible digital wallets.

### Constraints

1. **Time Constraints:**
   - POC should be developed and ready for demonstration within a defined timeline (e.g., 4-6 weeks).

2. **Resource Constraints:**
   - Limited budget for third-party services (e.g., hosting, payment processing fees).

3. **Security Constraints:**
   - Must comply with PCI DSS standards when handling credit card information.
   - Implement security best practices (e.g., input validation, SQL injection prevention).

4. **Performance Constraints:**
   - Initial POC should accommodate a certain number of simultaneous users (e.g., 100-200 concurrent users).
   - Load times for pages should be under 3 seconds.

5. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Adhere to local laws and regulations regarding e-commerce (such as GDPR for user data protection).

### Usability Considerations

1. **User Interface (UI):**
   - Simple, clean design for ease of navigation.
   - Accessibility considerations (color contrast, text size, ARIA landmarks).

2. **User Experience (UX):**
   - Smooth onboarding experience for new users.
   - Clear call-to-action buttons and guidance throughout the checkout process.

These specifications, requirements, and constraints form the foundation for the development of the POC and will help ensure that the core functionalities of the e-commerce platform are successfully demonstrated.
